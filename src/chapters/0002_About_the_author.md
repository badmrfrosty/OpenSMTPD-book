# About the author

I'm a senior software engineer,
IT architect,
certified hypnotherapist
and night classes student in work psychology.

After discovering Linux and BSD systems in the late 90s,
I started studying computer science at EPITECH Paris in 2001 and graduated in 2006.

I then held R&D software engineering positions at different companies working in security,
search engines,
distributed storage,
database,
mass-mailing and payment industries.

During that time,
I taught cryptography for developers,
Unix system programming and system administration classes as a guest teacher at Epitech,
and wrote various private publications on the topics of programming and security for the private and public sector.

Developer for the OpenBSD project from 2008 to 2020,
I started and maintained the OpenSMTPD project as one of its main developers during that period of time.
I still contribute to OpenSMTPD and assist OpenBSD developers with reviewing diffs but have shifted my focus to other projects.

Today,
my work activity is split between my part-time job as an IT architect and my hypnotherapy office.
