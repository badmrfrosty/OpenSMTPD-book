# About the author


I am a senior software engineer and IT architect. My journey into technology began in the late 90s when I discovered Linux and BSD systems. I pursued computer science at EPITECH Paris, graduating in 2006.

Following graduation, I held R&D software engineering positions in various industries, including security, search engines, distributed storage, databases, mass-mailing, and payments.

During this time, I taught cryptography, Unix system programming, and system administration classes at Epitech. I also authored several publications on programming and security for both private and public sectors.

From 2008 onwards, I contributed to the OpenBSD project, particularly as the founder and maintainer of the OpenSMTPD project. While I continue to support OpenSMTPD and assist OpenBSD developers, I also engage in other projects.

Today, I balance my time between my role as a part-time IT architect and contributing to software development projects.
