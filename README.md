**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.**

This project is based on a 120-ish pages book that I wrote in LaTeX,
but never completed and  never committed to freeze for a first version.
Since I can't eff-ing work something in private until completion,
I decided to progressively convert the book to markdown and work in a public repository.

Note that this work is released under [CC BY-NC-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/), please be nice.

You can use the issues tracker to submit fixes to typos,
suggest that I discuss a particular topic,
however keep in mind that this is a personal work written in my own style:
I will not necessarily merge changes in tone, style or wording.
